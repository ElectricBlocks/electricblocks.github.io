EBPP uses PandaPower to ensure that in-game results match what would actually occur in real life. You must have EBPP running for the Electric Blocks mod to work properly. In most cases, your instructor or organization should set up a server for you. If you&amp;rsquo;re an individual, then you&amp;rsquo;ll need a copy of this server running on your own machine for Electric Blocks to work.</description></item><item><title>Installation</title><link>https://electricblocks.github.io/docs/ebpp/installation/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Feb 2021 19:21:31 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://electricblocks.github.io/docs/ebpp/installation/</guid><description>Single-player Install This section is for users who have little or no server administration experience and are trying to set things up for single-player use. This section omits a lot of important information for multiplayer setups and includes a lot of unnecessary information on how to do every step on the install process. This is intended to make it as easy as possible for novices to get started. If you&amp;rsquo;re an IT administrator trying to setup a multiplayer server, please navigate to the Advanced Install section for a more detailed and concise guide.</description></item></channel></rss>
