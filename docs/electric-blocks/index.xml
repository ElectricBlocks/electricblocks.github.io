If not, please go back to the installation guides.
Blocks and Items Unlike other items in Minecraft, Electric Blocks cannot be crafted using in-game materials. The only way to obtain these blocks is through the creative menu or commands. We recommend that you use creative mode. When you&amp;rsquo;re in creative mode, press E on your keyboard to open up the menu (this may vary if you have alternative keybindings or control schemes).</description></item><item><title>About Electric Blocks</title><link>https://electricblocks.github.io/docs/electric-blocks/about-eb/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Feb 2021 20:45:16 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://electricblocks.github.io/docs/electric-blocks/about-eb/</guid><description>Electric Blocks is the Minecraft client/server mod that functions as the interface. This mod adds all the necessary blocks, tile entitites, guis, etc needed for power flow simulations. This mod will need to be installed on both the client and server to work properly. In single player, installing the mod on the client is equivalent to installing it on the server.</description></item></channel></rss>
