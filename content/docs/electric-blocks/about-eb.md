Electric Blocks is the Minecraft client/server mod that functions as the interface for EBPP. This mod adds all the necessary blocks, tile entities, GUIs, etc. needed for power flow simulations. In multiplayer, this mod must be installed on both the client and server to work properly. In single-player, only installing the mod on the client is necessary.
