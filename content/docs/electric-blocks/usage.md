This guide assumes you already have a working Electric Blocks mod installation. If not, please go back to the installation guides.

## Blocks and Items

Unlike other items in Minecraft, Electric Blocks cannot be crafted using in-game materials. The only way to obtain these blocks is through the creative menu or commands. We recommend that you use creative mode. When you're in creative mode, press `E` on your keyboard to open up the menu (this may vary if you have alternative keybindings or control schemes). Then click on the arrow in the top right.

If you have many mods enabled other than Electric Blocks, you may need to search the other creative tab pages, but eventually you should find a tab that looks like the one marked in this image:

Click on this tab to open it and you should see the menu for all Electric Blocks that looks like this:

You can now drag the blocks from that tab into your inventory hotbar at the bottom of the menu. You can hover over the block to get the name of the block. Once the blocks are in your inventory, you can use these to build an electrical network in the Minecraft world. Here is an animated GIF showing you how you can create a very simple network consisting of an external grid, several wires, and a lamp block.
