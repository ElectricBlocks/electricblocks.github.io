So you want to use Electric Blocks, but you don't have any IT admins running a server for you? Don't worry, Electric Blocks works just fine in single-player.

{{< alert icon="⚠️" text="Running Electric Blocks and EBPP on the same computer will increase the workload on it. We recommend that you use a reasonably modern computer while using the Electric Blocks mod and EBPP at the same time. If this is not an option, check with your educational institution to see if they can setup a multiplayer server and public EBPP instance." >}}

Unfortunately, single-player setup is a bit more complicated as the Electric Blocks mod isn't packaged with a copy of EBPP. Fortunately, the installation process isn't too difficult regardless.

## 1. Install Electric Blocks Mod

First, you need to install the Electric Blocks mod onto your system. If you followed the [Quick Start](</docs/prologue/quick-start>) guide, then you're already done! If you haven't followed the [Quick Start](</docs/prologue/quick-start>) guide, go there and follow it, and come back here when you're done.

## 2. Install EBPP

The Electric Blocks mod is really just your user interface to the simulation server. All power systems created in Minecraft are processed externally by a simulation server called EBPP. To install EBPP, go to the [EBPP Installation](</docs/ebpp/installation>) page and follow the instructions. Unless you know what you're doing, we **highly** recommend that you go with the `Docker Installation` and install EBPP on the same computer that you plan to use the Electric Blocks mod on. Docker will minimize the amount of extra configuration that you need to do.

## 3. Launch and Play

Now you should be able to launch EBPP and start using the Electric Blocks mod! If you installed Electric Blocks and EBPP on the same computer, then you should be good to jump into Creative mode and get simulating. If you didn't (i.e., you're setting up a multiplayer server), then you can find guidance on the [EBPP Installation](</docs/ebpp/installation>) page. Enjoy using Electric Blocks!
