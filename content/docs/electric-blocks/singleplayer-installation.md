So you want to use Electric Blocks, but you don't have any IT admins running a server for you? Don't worry, Electric Blocks works just fine in singleplayer.

{{< alert icon="⚠️" text="Running Electric Blocks and EBPP on the same computer will increase the workload on it. We recommend that you use a reasonably modern computer when using the Electric Blocks mod and EBPP at the same time. If this is not an option, check with your educational institution to see if they can setup a multiplayer server or public EBPP instance." >}}

Unfortunately, single-player setup is a bit more complicated as the Electric Blocks mod isn't packaged with a copy of EBPP. Fortunately, the installation process isn't too difficult regardless.

## 1. Install Electric Blocks Mod

First, you need to install the Electric Blocks mod onto your system. If you followed the [Quick Start](</docs/prologue/quick-start>) guide, then you're already done! If you haven't followed the [Quick Start](</docs/prologue/quick-start>) guide, go there and follow it, and come back here when you're done.

## 2. Install EBPP

Now you have the mod installed, but the mod is really just your user interface to the simulation server. All power systems created in Minecraft are handled externally by a simulation server called EBPP. To install EBPP, go to the [EBPP Installation](</docs/ebpp/installation>) guide and follow the instructions. Unless you know what you're doing, we **highly** recommend that you go with the `Docker Installation` and install EBPP on the same computer that you plan to use the Electric Blocks mod on. Doing this will minimize the amount of extra configuration that you need to do.

## 3. Launch and Play

Now you should be able launch EBPP and and start using the Minecraft mod! You should start by launching EBPP first. How exactly you do this will depend on your operating system and installation method. More guidance on how to do this can be found in the EBPP documentation. If you installed Electric Blocks and EBPP on the same computer, then you shouldn't need to do any more configuration. If you didn't, then you might be able to find the guidance you need on the [Multiplayer Installation](</docs/electric-blocks/multiplayer-installation>) page. Just launch Minecraft and create or load a creative singleplayer session, and you're ready to go! Enjoy using Electric Blocks!
