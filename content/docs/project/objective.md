The overall objective of this mod is to enable the creation and use of realistic and accurate virtual reality models of electric power transmission, distribution, control, and usage scenarios for research and instruction purposes.

Why did we create this mod? There are several mods modeling energy and mechanis. There are also a couple of mods for simulating electrical systems. However, these mods do not model electrical systems and their operation and control in a way that is realistic enough to enable quality research and education.

That is where Electric Blocks comes in. Electric Blocks enables realistic modeling of power flows using the PandaPower API. This API is thoroughly tested against commercial software and so power flow systems created in-game will function just like real their real world counterparts.

The software traditionally used for running power flow simulations is expensive and difficult to use. It can take many hours of practice and learning for novices to setup even the most simple of power flow circuits.

Electric Blocks aims to completely change this paradigm. With this mod, anyone can get in game and start connecting parts together. Setting up an electrical lamp with a connection to a coal generator is easy and gives immediate feedback. For those more technically inclined, power settings can be tweaked and monitored in game. Power distribution has never been as accessible as it is with Electric Blocks!

Electric Blocks uses Minecraft as a virtualized world where people can practice building power distribution systems without any danger and zero up front costs.
