EBPP is the simulation server that runs power flow calculations for the Electric Blocks mod. EBPP uses [PandaPower](http://pandapower.org/) to ensure that in-game results match what would actually occur in real life. You **must** have EBPP running for the Electric Blocks mod to work properly. In most cases, your instructor or organization should set up a server for you. If you're an individual, then you'll need a copy of this server running on your own machine for Electric Blocks to work.
