## Normal Installation

{{< alert icon="ðŸ’¡" text="This guide only applies if you're connecting to a mulitplayer server hosted by someone else. For single player or multiplayer setup, please review the entire installation guide." >}}

### 1. Install Minecraft

Minecraft Java Edition is required to use this mod. If you have Minecraft installed you can skip this step.

Otherwise go to the minecraft website and download and install it: <https://www.minecraft.net/download>

After downloading the client, double-click the icon to run it.

### 2. Install Forge

Once Minecraft is finished installing, make sure all Minecraft windows are closed. Then go to the Forge website and download the recommended installer here: <http://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.15.2.html>

Once the Forge installer is done downloading, open the file to run it. The Forge installer will pop up. Make sure that the `Install client` button is selected. Click `Ok` and the installer will start installation.

### 3. Install Electric Blocks

Once the Forge installer has completed, you will need to install the Electric Blocks mod. You can find an official relase on our downloads page here: <https://github.com/ElectricBlocks/electricblocks/releases>

Download the file and place it in your mods folder. This will vary based on your system but it can usually be found here:

Windows: `C:\Users\Your Username\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft`

Mac: `/Users/Your Username/Library/Application Support/minecraft`

Linux: `	~/.minecraft`

### 4. Launch Minecraft

Now that everything is installed you can launch Minecraft. Make sure you have `Minecraft: Java Edition` selected in the Minecraft client. Before pressing `Play`, verify that `Forge 1.15.2 is` selected. The option is located to the left of the `Play` button. Once selected, you can press `Play` and start using Minecraft. Once the game has fully launched and you are on the title screen, select Multiplayer. Your server administrator should have provided details for how to connect from here.
