## Normal Installation

{{< alert icon="ðŸ’¡" text="For full single-player and multiplayer installation, please review the Singleplayer Installation and EBPP Installation pages." >}}

### 1. Install Minecraft

Minecraft Java Edition is required to use this mod. If you have Minecraft installed already, you can skip this step.

Otherwise go to the Minecraft website and download and install it: <https://www.minecraft.net/download>

After downloading the client, double-click the icon to run it.

### 2. Install Forge

Once Minecraft is finished installing, make sure all Minecraft windows are closed. Then go to the Forge website and download the recommended 1.15.2 installer here: <http://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.15.2.html>

Once the Forge installer is done downloading, open the file to run it. The Forge installer will pop up. Make sure that the `Install client` button is selected. Click `OK` and the installer will start installation.

### 3. Install Electric Blocks

Once the Forge installer has completed, you will need to install the Electric Blocks mod. You can find an official release on our downloads page here: <https://github.com/ElectricBlocks/electricblocks/releases>

Download the `.jar` file and place it in your mods folder. This will vary based on your system but it can usually be found here:

Windows: `C:\Users\Your Username\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft`

Mac: `/Users/Your Username/Library/Application Support/minecraft`

Linux: `	~/.minecraft`

### 4. Install HWYLA

Electric Blocks **requires** the mod "Here's What You're Looking At" to run. A download link for Minecraft 1.15.2 can be found here: <https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hwyla/files/2880069>

Download the `.jar` file (it should be something along the lines of `Hwyla-forge-1.10.8-B72_1.15.2.jar`) and place it in your mods folder, as in step 3.

### 5. (Single-player) Install and Launch EBPP

The Electric Blocks mod requires a connection to the EB simulation server software, EBPP. If you're installing and using Electric Blocks exclusively on your local machine in single-player mode, you'll need to go to the [Single-player Installation](/docs/electric-blocks/singleplayer-installation/) page and follow the extra instructions there.

### 6. Launch Minecraft

Now that everything is installed, you can launch Minecraft. Make sure you have `Minecraft: Java Edition` selected in the Minecraft client. Before pressing `Play`, verify that `Forge 1.15.2` is selected. The option is located to the left of the `Play` button. Once selected, you can press `Play` and start using Minecraft. If you're a student or otherwise have a multiplayer server set up for you by an institution, select Multiplayer. Your server administrator should have provided details for how to connect from here.
